# Problem 1

## part 0 - setup

call the library **moderndive** and **tidyverse** and install the
dataset *early_january_weather* (library **tidyverse** is also used in
problem 2)

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
data("early_january_weather")
problem1_df = early_january_weather
```

## part 1 - description of the dataset (partial code and dataset description)

``` r
variable_name = c(names(problem1_df))
num_row = nrow(problem1_df)
num_col = ncol(problem1_df)
mean_temp = mean(pull(problem1_df, temp))

data_year = unique(pull(problem1_df, year))
data_site = unique(pull(problem1_df, origin))
start_day = with(problem1_df, min(day))
end_day = with(problem1_df, max(day))
```

The installed dataset contains variables *origin, year, month, day,
hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip,
pressure, visib, time_hour*; it contains *358* rows and *15* columns.
The mean temperature in the reported days is *39.58*. **Additonal
information**: The data is collected in the year *2013* in *EWR* from
day *1* to *15*.

## part 2 - make a scatterplot plot

``` r
ggplot(problem1_df, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, colour = humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_tj2519_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("problem1_scatterplot.pdf")
```

Describe the pattern of the plot: the temperature increases in general
as time goes, even though it fluctuates during the period of data
collection.The humid level also tends to increase (but also fluctuates).

# Problem 2

## part 1 - create a dataframe and try to take the mean of each variable

``` r
problem2_df = tibble(
  norm_sample = rnorm(10),
  norm_samp_log = norm_sample > 0,
  vec_char = c("apple", "banana", "peach", "flash", "milk", "cookie", "sparkle",
               "tigger", "melon", "cauliflower"),
  fac_char = factor(c("dog", "dog", "dog", "sloth", "dog", "cat", "cat", "cat", 
                      "cat", "dog"))
)

mean(pull(problem2_df, norm_sample))
```

    ## [1] 0.3153531

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, norm_samp_log))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, fac_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, fac_char)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

When we try to take the mean of each variable, we can take the mean of
the numeric and the logical variable. We cannot take the mean of a
character or a factor vector.

## part 2 - apply the as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor variables

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, norm_samp_log))
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, fac_char))
```

We can return numeric values for the logical and factor vector, but “NA”
will be returned for the character vector, and that might be the reason
why we cannot take the mean of a character variable. As for the factor
vector, even though numeric values are returned after **as.numeric**
function is returned, we could not calculate the mean, that might
because the numeric values returned for the factor ‘levels’ do not have
a ‘meaning’.
