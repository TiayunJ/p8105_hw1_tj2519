# Problem 1

## part 0 - setup

call the library **moderndive** and **tidyverse** and install the
dataset *early_january_weather*

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
data("early_january_weather")
problem1_df = early_january_weather
```

## part 1 - description of the dataset (partial code and dataset description)

``` r
variable_name = c(names(problem1_df))
num_row = nrow(problem1_df)
num_col = ncol(problem1_df)
mean_temp = mean(pull(problem1_df, temp))

data_year = unique(pull(problem1_df, year))
data_site = unique(pull(problem1_df, origin))

start_day = with(problem1_df, min(day))
end_day = with(problem1_df, max(day))
```

The installed dataset contains variables *origin, year, month, day,
hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip,
pressure, visib, time_hour*; it contains *358* rows and *15* columns.
The mean temperature in the reported days is *39.58*. **Additonal
information**: The data is collected in the year *2013* in *EWR* from
day *1* to *15*.

## part 2 - make a scatterplot plot

``` r
ggplot(problem1_df, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, colour = humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_tj2519_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("problem1_scatterplot.pdf")
```

Describe the pattern of the plot: the temperature increases in general
as time goes, even though it fluctuates during the period of data
collection.The humid level also tends to increase (but also fluctuates).
